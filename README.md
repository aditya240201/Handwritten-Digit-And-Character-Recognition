# Handwritten-Digit-and-Character-recognition
#Here I have created a project for recognising handwritten digits and characters using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).
##This is what I have done:-
### >Imported the tensorflow library and from which imported the MNIST data set and the Keras framework for creating a sequencial model.
### >Normalized the data
### >Resized the images to make them suitable for applying Convolution operatoin.
### >Created a deep neural network with 5 epochs.
### >Saved the model for further testing
## #I have also tested the model on real time images which are usually in rbg colors, by turning them into gray scale and then making predictions on them using the model.
## To run the code:
### 1.Clone the github repository in your computer. git clone https://github.com/shishank2311/Handwritten-Digit-And-Character-Recognition.git
### 2.Run TRAINING.ipynb file which will Train our model for handwritten digit recognition and will save the model as 'saved_model'. 
### 3.Run TESTING.ipynb file to test the created model and predict the digits inside the input images.
